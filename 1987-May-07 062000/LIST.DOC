			  Description of Use
			  ------------------

   Command  LIST
   -------------


   Purpose:
	   You use LIST to display  files on your monitor, line  by line
	with the aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands.


   Format:
		 LIST  [d:][path]filename[.ext]


   Remarks:
	   You may rename the program file to any convenient name,  such
	as  L.COM,  READ.COM,  or LIST.COM.

	   Using LIST is fairly straight forward.  You type the  command
	LIST at the DOS  prompt, followed by the  name of the file  that
	you want to see.  For example: LIST CONFIG.SYS would display the
	file CONFIG.SYS.

	   Once the file  is displayed on  your screen, you  may use the
	cursor positioning keys to  move around and see  different parts
	of the file.  For example,  when LIST first starts, you  see the
	first 23 lines of the file.  To see the next 23 lines, or  page,
	press the PgDn key.   The PgUp key moves  you back one page  and
	shows you the  previous 23 lines.   The up-arrow and  down-arrow
	keys move it  one line at a time.  When you are finished,  press
	the ESCape key and you are returned to the DOS prompt.

	   The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted  to
	enter  a filename.   You  may  include	drive,	path,  and  wild
	cards in the file name.   The first file which matches that name
	is displayed.  After  the file is displayed, the next file which
	matches the "filename" may be displayed, too.

	   You may also use LIST  to display piped or redirected  files.
	If you are unfamiliar with these, you may skip to the next page.

	To display a redirected file, use a < (less than symbol)  before
	the name  of the  file	and  add the  /S parameter  to the  LIST
	command.  For example:

		dir a: >xyz
		list <xyz /s

	To display a piped file,  omit the filename,  but supply the /S.
		dir a: | list /s

	Or, to LIST a file within an ARC archive:
		arc /p arcname.arc filename.ext | list /s
				- or -
		arce arcname filename.ext /p | list /S

			 Description of Use (cont'd)
			 ------------------

	   Because  files  contain  different  kinds  of data, there are
	several commands  to tell  LIST how  to display  the data.   The
	process that LIST uses to make the file data readable is  called
	filtering.  The filters in LIST can:

	    o  replace non-text and control characters with blanks
	    o  expand TAB characters
	    o  display line drawing characters
	    o  change 8-bit (W*) data to readable 7-bit text
	    o  display the hexidecimal values for each character
	    o  remove "junk", such as control codes and backspaces

	   LIST was  designed to  display ASCII  files.  That  is, files
	which  contain	text, and  not	binary	or  control codes.  Text
	characters usually  range from	a value  of 32	to 127.  To view
	binary	files  (COM,  EXE,  etc),  the	alt-H (hex dump display)
	command is available.


	   Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are  replaced with a funny
	character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been
	encountered.  This  character is  an upside-down  question mark.
	Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may be
	displayed  if  the  '8'  command  is  in effect.  To insure that
	characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7'
	command.


	   The top  line of  the display  gives the  file name,  current
	right  scroll  offset,	and  the  FILE's creation date and time.
	Optionally, a ruler  may be displayed  on the top  line by using
	the alt-R keys.

	   The	file  is  displayed  with  one	logical  record  on each
	80-column display line.   A logical record  ends in a  linefeed.
	The maximum logical record may	be 256 characters long.  If  the
	record exceeds 80  characters, you may	view the portion  beyond
	the 80 columns	by using the  scroll right command,  or by using
	the  Wrap  feature.   The  Wrap  command  toggles  ON or OFF the
	wrapping  of  lines  longer  than  80 characters.  With Wrap on,
	lines are displayed in their entirety, 80 characters per display
	line.  The scroll -left  and -right functions are  disabled when
	Wrap is ON.

	   The file may  be PRINTed as	it it displayed.   The P command
	toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P
	command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines
	are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by
	entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but
	the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the
	file.  Empty lines  cause a line  to be skipped  on the printer.
|	The letter P  is displayed on the bottom command     line  while
|	printing. See the section on extracting lines for other methods.

LIST	 Page 6

			Positioning to Lines
			--------------------

	   Each displayable line of the file is assigned a line  number.
	The first line is assigned line number 1.  The highest allowable
	line  number  is  65535.   In  order  to determine the last line
	number, the  entire file  must be  read.  For  this reason,  the
	first time that the END (bottom) command is issued, it will take
	longer	to  process.   This  is  not  necessary  if  the file is
	preloaded using the alt-L installation option.

	   If the  Wrap option	is in  effect, there  is one line number
	required for each 80 bytes of the file's records.

	   If the hex dump option is in effect, there is one line number
	required for each 16 bytes of the file.

	   You	may  position  to  a  specific	line number by using the
	c-Home, Ctrl key  and Home key,  or the #  key.  When c-Home  is
	entered, you are prompted for the line number.	Enter the 1 to 5
	digit line number.   The display will  now begin with  that line
	number at the top of the screen.

	   To position forward or backward, you may use the + (plus), or
	- (minus) keys.  You are  prompted to enter the number	of lines
	to be skipped.	The display resumes at the line number shown  on
	the top (status)  line, plus or  minus the number  of lines that
	you specified.

	   When  you  change  a  filter  option,  such as Wrap, the line
	numbering changes.  An attempt is  made to retain the same  file
	position.


			Displaying multiple files
			 -------------------------

	   You can display more than one file by supplying wildcards  in
	the file name.	For example,  LIST *.DOC will display all  files
	with an extension of DOC.

|	   To display the next file, you use the Q or ctrl-PgDn command.
	When the last file has been displayed,	you  can  exit	LIST  by
	using the  X,  F10,  ESCape, or alt-X commands, depending on how
	you want the screen to look when LIST ends.

	   To display the previous file, you use the ctrl-PgUp	(control
|	and PgUp keys together).  LIST can keep track of up to 20  files
	at once.

	   Another way to LIST	more than one file  is to use the  alt-F
	command.  Alt-F asks you for a new file name, and you may  enter
	a simple file name, or one that includes wild cards.  These  new
	file names are added to the table of filenames that LIST  keeps.
	Thus, you can use alt-F for several different filenames, and use
|	the ctrl-PgDn and ctrl-PgUp commands to move among them.

							LIST	 Page 7


			Marking and Extracting Lines
			----------------------------

	   There are two ways that lines can be extracted from a file:

	      o  with the P (print) command, and
	      o  with the alt-D (dump data) command.

	   The lines to be extracted are either the current lines on the
	screen, or lines that you  have marked with the alt-M  and alt-B
	commands.

	   To mark lines,  you use either  the alt-M or  alt-B commands.
	The alt-M command  marks the top  line on the  screen, and alt-B
	marks the bottom line on the screen.  You can use either or both
	commands to mark the starting and ending lines (in the range  of
	lines  to  be  extracted).   The  marked  lines are displayed in
	reverse video.

	   After you have marked a range of lines, you use the P (print)
	command to print all of the  marked lines.  Or, you can use  the
	alt-D (dump data) command to  write those lines to a  file.  The
	alt-D command asks you	for a file name.   If the file does  not
	exist, a new one is  created.  If the files already  exists, the
	extracted lines are added (appended) to the file.

	   For example, you  would like to  have LIST filter  out all of
	the junk in a file, and then write a new file.	To do this,  you
	might enter the following sequence of commands:

		list TESTDATA		... display your TESTDATA file
		alt-J			... filters out the junk
		alt-M			... marks line 1 (top line)
		END			... positions to end of file
		alt-B			... marks the bottom line
						     (last line)
		alt-D			... dumps data to a file
		TESTDATE.NEW		... you enter the new file name
		alt-X			... quit and return to DOS


|	   Once you have marked a range of lines, use of alt-M	or alt-B
|	does not reset the entire line range.  The  first or last marked
|	line may change, but both do not change.  Use the  alt-U command
|	to unmark lines, especially after alt-D (dump) to be sure.

			 Display Format
			 --------------

	   The monitor display is defined in terms of lines and columns.
	A typical monitor can display 25 lines of 80 columns each.  LIST
	attempts to use the number of lines and columns for the  monitor
	mode in use.  For example, if the monitor is in 40 column  mode,
	LIST displays only 40 characters per line.  And, if the  monitor
	is set for other than 25 lines, such as 35 or 43, LIST uses that
	number of lines.

|	   If you use the  alt-E command  to change  EGA modes,  the EGA
|	pallette,  cursor,  and other  settings are  set to  DOS default
|	values.  LIST does not preserve fonts or pallettes.

	   The top line of the	display is called  the Status line.  The
	bottom line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are
	called the  primary  display  window,  and are usually lines two
	through 24.


			 Status Line Format
			 ------------------

	The Status line has the following format:

		LIST   lllll nnnnnnn +sss mm/dd/yy hh:mm  - filename

	where,

	'LIST'     is the name of this program

	'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the
		   display window (usually on line 2)

	'nnnnnnn'  is the line number of the last record, if known

	'+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in
|		   multiples of 10, corresponding to the number
		   of columns that the display has been shifted
		   to the right to view records longer than 80

	'mm/dd/yy' is the file's creation date (not today's date)
	'hh:mm'    is the file's creation time (not today's time)


	Note:	   The date and time  shown on the top line is	NOT  the
	       current date.  It is the date and time  that the file was
	       created.







							LIST	 Page 9

			 Command Line Format
			 -------------------

	The Command line has the following format:

      command message _________ Options: hbkmpswtalj Keys: X=exit ?=Help
					  -----------
	where,

	'command' indicates the current process:

	  'Command'   you are being asked to enter a command
		       enter the letter, or press the keys for
		       the action to perform

	  'Reading '   the file data is being read
	  'Filter  '   the file data is being formatted for display
|	  'Looking '   the Scan/Find text is being searched for

	  'Scan   '   you are being asked to enter text to locate
	  'Find   '   in the file, up to 31 characters may be entered

	  '# lines?'   you are being asked to enter a 1 to 5 digit
		       number that is the amount of lines to skip

	  'Line #? '   you are being asked to enter a 1 to 5 digit
		       line number to which the display is to be
		       positioned


	'message' may be one of:

	  '*** Text not found ***'
	   the Scan/Text was not found in the file

	  '   *** Top of file ***'
	   the first line of the file is being displayed

	  '   *** End-of-file ***'
	   the last line of the file is being displayed

	St: indicate status of toggles, lower case means off:

	'H'       indicates that the hex Dump display option is in use
	'b'       indicates whether the 7-bit, 8-bit, or *-option is
		  in use
	'K'       indicates that the Keyboard flush option is in use
	'M'       indicates that tests for monitor retrace are not made
	'P'       indicates that Print is in use
	'S'       indicates that file closing (for sharing) is in use
	'W'       indicates that the Wrap mode is in effect
	'T'       indicates that TAB characters are expanded
	'A'       indicates APXCORE interface, 'a' for TV/DV/DD
	'L'       indicates that the pre-loading option is on
	'J'       indicates that line feeds are added to lone carriage
		  return control characters, and backspaces are handled


LIST	 Page 10



			 Screen Colors
			 -------------

	   The screen's lines may be in any of three different colors:

		o  the 'special' color for the top status line and the
		   bottom command line
		o  the 'normal' color for the file's text windows
		o  the 'bright' color for lines with Find/Scan text,
		   and for the upside-down question mark in 7-bit mode

	   There is a pair of function keys assigned to each color.  You
	may  use  these  function  keys  to  change  the  background and
	foreground  colors  temporarily.   To  make  the  color  changes
	permanent, you may use the cloning command (alt-C), or use DEBUG
	to modify the program file.

	   The colors used  for displaying the	titles and main  body of
	text  may  be  changed	temporarily  or  permanently.  To make a
	permanent  change,  the  cloning  command  alt-C  is  used.   It
	requires that the LIST.COM program file be on the current  drive
	and in the current directory.

	   The border is not  changed.	The foreground color  applies to
	the characters displayed.


	The color attributes may be changed by using these function keys:

	  For the main body of text:

		F5 - background color
		F6 - foreground color

	  For the top and bottom lines:

		F7 - background color
		F8 - foreground color

	  For the line with Find/Scan text:

		F2 - background color
		F4 - foreground

	   Once you  have decided  upon the  colors,  use the alt-C  key
	combination to change the LIST.COM program file.

			 Cloning Procedure
			 -----------------

	   The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the  file
	closing (C) and ruler (alt-R) options may be permanently set  in
	the program by using the alt-C cloning function.

	   For	cloning  to  take  effect,  the  program  must be called
	LIST.COM and it must be on the current drive and in the  current
	directory.  There are two versions of the LIST COM file.  One is
	the normal  program.  The  other, which  contains an  'S' as the
	last letter of	the file name,	is a slightly  smaller file that
	excludes  the  Help  screen.   You  may  use either COM file for
	cloning.

	   The clonable options (command toggles) are:

	     M	    =  Mono monitor, affects retrace testing,
	     C	    =  file(s) are shared,
	     W	    =  Wrap long lines
	     8/7/*  =  display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special case
	     K	    =  flush Keyboard each time a command is read

	     alt-A  =  set on if using Apxcore, off if using Double Dos
		       or TopView, or DesqView

	     alt-H  =  hex dump display, like the DEBUG format

	     alt-J  =  toggle "junk" filter, add LF to CR, fix backspaces

	     alt-L  =  set on to force preloading (reading) of the
		       entire file before any lines are displayed,
		       Default is OFF.

	     alt-R  =  toggle columnar ruler on top line

	     alt-T  =  toggle expansion of TAB characters


	Note: Be  sure you  have no  other copies  of LIST.COM which are
	accessible (because of a filepath type of utility).















LIST	 Page 12

			 DEBUG Information
			 -----------------

	   An alternative to cloning is  to use DEBUG to make  permanent
	changes.  Here is a list of key items and their addresses:

|	   0124 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 01 (blue)
		  Refer to a technical reference guide for the
		  attribute values for the colors that you want.
|	   0126 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 02 (green)
|	   0128 - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 0C (bright red)
|	   012A - clonable options;
|	       MRSJ WHK*  M = mono, retrace testing if off, x'01'
			  R = ruler, x'02'
			  S = shared, x'04'
|			  J = add LF to lone CR, process backspaces,
|			      if on, x'08'; default is off
			  W = wrap mode, x'10'
			  H = hi-bit on, x'20'
			  K = kybd flush, x'40'
			  * = special document filtering, x'80'
|	   012B - more clonable options, not all are indicated:
|	       .PAT DGV.  P = Preload file if on, x'02', default is off
			  A = Apxcore if on, TV/DD/DV if off, x'04,
			      default is for Topview/Double DOS use
			  T = if on (default), expand TABs, x'08'
|			  D = hex display mode if on, x'10'
			  G = if on, alt-G goto DOS is Disabled, x'20'
			  V = if on, screen save/restore is Disabled
			      and 9K less memory is used/required, x'40'

	By  specifying	the  bit  value,  the  option  is  enabled.  For
	example, to enable  Shared and Retrace,  specify a hex	value of
	the sum, or 01+04 = 05.
|	   012C - row less one at which found text is displayed,  1 byte
|		  the default is 08 which displays found text on line  9
|	   012E - scroll offset value,	default is 10 (x'0A'),  one byte
|	   0130 - scroll starting value, default is 0 (x'00'), one byte
|	   0132 - tab increment, must be power of 2, default is 8
|	   0134 - tab mask, subtract tab incr from FFFFh,default is FFF8

	   When  the  Find/Scan  command  is  used,  the next line which
	contains that text is highlighted using the 'bright' color,  and
	is placed in  row 9 of	the screen.  You  can change the  row by
|	altering the byte  at location 12C  which is normally  '08', one
	less than the row.

	   The letters and command keys may also be changed.  There  are
	two tables involved: WHAT and WHERE.  The WHAT table contains  a
	list of  one-byte keyboard  codes.  The  WHERE table  contains a
	list  of  two-byte  matching  addresses.   If you really want to
	change the codes, here are the DEBUG addresses:

|	   035E - WHAT eye catcher
|	   0362 - table of key codes,  ASCII 0-127,  then extended 0-132
|	   0467 - WHERE eye catcher
|	   046C - list of two byte addresses of processing routines

			 Scanning for text
			 -----------------


	   You may  use Find  (\) to  search for  text regardless of the
|	case, or you may use Scan (/) to find an exact match. The search
|	begins	at  the  top  line  displayed  and proceeds in a forward
|	direction until the end of file.  You may  start a  search  that
|	goes backwards rather than  forwards by using the ` (left quote)
|	key  instead of Find (\), or by using ' (right quote) instead of
|	Scan (/).

	   To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed  by
	one or more (up to 31)	characters.  The Scan text, but not  the
	slash,	is  displayed  on  the	command  line.	The Scan is case
	sensitive.  That is, lower case Scan text will only match  lower
	case file text.

	   While  the  program	is  searching  for  the text, the bottom
	display line  is changed  to say  "Scanning".   Pressing ANY key
	while the search  is in progress  will terminate the  search and
	display the message 'Text not found' on the bottom line.

	   If the text is found, the line containing it is  displayed as
|	a high-intensity line (bright color) in the middle of the screen
|	depending on the value of the Find Row (see cloning section).

	   If the text is NOT found, the command line (25) is changed to
	say '*** text not found ***', and the display remains unchanged.

	   To find the next occurrance of the same text, use the  A)gain
	command, or press the F3 key.  To find the previous occurance,
	press the F9 key.

	   If the  PCED keyboard  enhancement program  is installed, the
	up/down cursor keys  may be used  to recall and  edit previously
	entered Scan/Find text.

	   In a shared file environment, if the file changes while being
	listed,  the  file  position  may  become invalid.  Use the HOME
	command  to  insure  proper  file  synchronization, or use the C
	or alt-S command again.

|	   If  the  display  has been scrolled right or left so that the
|	"found"  text is not visible, you will see a funny symbol in the
|	first  column.	This  is  the same symbol that is displayed on a
|	blank line while changing the Find/Scan colors.  It is there  so
|	that you can tell that the line is marked.

			 Filtering
			 ---------

	   Filtering is the term used to describe the process that  LIST
	uses to  format file  data for	displaying on  a monitor.  After
	data  is  read	from  a  file,	it  is	filtered.  The method of
	filtering depends upon the options in effect.

	   For a typical  ASCII text file,  the filter removes	carriage
	return and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters.


			 Hi-bit Filter
			 -------------
	   The	7,  8,	and  *	(asterisk)  commands  determine  whether
	characters above ASCII-127 are displayed.  If the hi-bit  option
	is off (7  command), the filter  strips the high  order bit from
	each character.   If the  hi-bit option  is on	(8 command), all
	characters, including  graphic characters  above ASCII-127,  are
	displayed.

			 Star Filter
			 -----------

	   The	star  (*  or  asterisk)  command  displays  only   ASCII
	characters below 128 (x'80'), but treats the special  characters
	x'8A'  and  x'8D'  as  line-feed  and  carriage-return   control
	characters.   Any  other  characters  above  127  are treated as
	spaces, and control codes below ASCII-26 are replaced by blanks.

	   The Wrap option causes the  filtering to insure that no  line
	exceeds the width of the monitor, e.g. 80 characters.

			 Junk Filter
			 -----------

	   The alt-J  command toggles  the "junk"  filter which  insures
	that carriage  returns in  the file  also result  in a new line.
	Also, backspace characters result in "backing up" the display by
	one position.  This  allows more readability  of files that  use
	backspacing to emphasize, or over-write, characters.


			 Hex Format Filter
			 -----------------

	   The hex dump option (alt-H) causes the filtering to	reformat
	the file  data into  a DEBUG-like  display format.   The largest
	file that can be displayed in Hex is 1 million bytes.

	   An attempt is made to retain the file position when switching
	from normal to hex-dump  display, but due to  filtering changing
	record lengths,  the hex  display may  begin before  the current
	record.

	NOTE:	The  EOF  control character is	ignored in this version.

			File Sharing
			------------

	   LIST uses two techniques for allowing you to share files with
	other processes.

	   The first technique is called file closing and is enabled  by
	the C or alt-S commands.   This forces LIST to close  the viewed
	file unless it needs to read from the file.  If enough memory is
	available, the entire file may be loaded once and thus leave the
	file free for exclusive access by other processes.

	   The	second	technique  is  called  file  sharing.	It  is a
	function of  DOS and  requires DOS  version 3.0  or later.  LIST
	opens the viewed  files with a	DENY NONE request.   This allows
	other processes to  read and write  to the file  if they do  not
	request exclusive use of the  file.  If a file is  not available
	to  LIST  because  it  is  locked  by  another process, you will
	receive the error message "File not found" or "Acccess  denied".
	There is  no command  to enable  or disable  this method of file
	sharing.  It is implicit with the use of DOS version 3.


			Invoking DOS Commands
			---------------------

	   If  the  "goto  DOS"  option  is  enabled, you may invoke DOS
|	commands by using the alt-G command.  LIST reserves about 66k of
|	memory for its own use.  This  increases LIST's  memory require-
|	ments to approximately 96k when using alt-G.  The remaining mem-
|	ory is available to the DOS commands.


	   After you have  finished entering DOS  commands, use the  DOS
	EXIT command to return to LIST.

	   To disable  the "goto  DOS" function,  you must  use DEBUG to
	alter the option  byte described in  the section about	cloning.
	With it disabled, LIST requires less memory, about 66K.


			Screen Saving
			-------------

	   If  the  screen  saving  option  is	enabled,  LIST saves the
	contents of the current display screen when it starts.	You  can
	restore  the  original	screen	by  exiting  LIST with the alt-X
	command.

	   Screen saving requires  approximately 10k more  memory.  This
	is sufficient to save 60 lines of 80 characters (EGA 8x6  mode).
	See the section about cloning for information about enabling and
	disabling the screen saving feature.

			Restrictions
			------------

	  o  The program requires 66K bytes of memory. If more memory is
	     available, it is used to store more of the file in  memory.
	     At least 96K is required to  use the DOS shell.  Add 9K  if
	     the screen saving option is enabled (default).

	  o  The line number is currently limited to 65535.

	  o  The  file	size  is  limited  to 16 million bytes for ASCII
|	     files, and to 1 million bytes for hex-dump files,	but only
|	     the first 65535 records are processed.

	  o  PC DOS Version 2.0 or later is required. DOS version 3.0
	     or later is required for file sharing.

	  o  ANSI.SYS is NOT required.

	APX Core, DesqView, TopView, and Double DOS, IBM,  Sigma are all
	copyrighted,  trademarked,  and all that.
